# atom-sits

The atom-sits package brings functionality to help developers of SITS:Vision with editing files written in SRLText.

## Syntax highlighter
The syntax highlighter injects itself into other grammars, so should work within HTML documents (it has a bit of trouble with SQL at the moment). Alternatively, you can set the language to "SRLText". The syntax highlighter recognises tags, variables, SLPs, formatting commands (e.g. &S) and SEL statements.

## Gold characters
Allows you to quickly enter SITS "gold" characters by preceding suitable keys with "Escape".

Works with the following characters:
 * <
 * \>
 * ;
 * \*
 * !
 * |
 * =
 * &
